SOLICITATION & BINDING OPTION TERM SHEET
Subject: Discrete Lattice Resonance Architecture (DLRA) for Deterministic Holographic Signal Processing, including Octad-Dimensional Optical Pulse ISA, Compiler Frameworks, Runtime, and Simulation Systems Controlling Priority Date: February 20, 2026 (U.S. Provisional Patent Application Filed) 
Inventors/Owners: Charles Tibedo & Cory Newton
________________________________________
	OVERVIEW OF TERMS
1. Absolute Priority and Explicit Claim Scope
February 20, 2026 U.S. Provisional Patent Application Filed:
"Discrete Lattice Resonance Architecture and Associated Octad-Dimensional Optical Pulse Instruction Set, Compiler Frameworks, and Associated Systems for Single-Transit Photonic Computing."
Absolute priority is established and legally locked for the explicitly disclosed and enabled generalized embodiments across multiple electromagnetic, quantum, and topological substrates. The February 20, 2026 priority embodies:
	DLRA Hardware Across All Substrates: Fixed-topology computation cores executing global algebraic operations via engineered lattice connectivity and nodal sampling. Priority explicitly covers optical substrates (quartz, silicon nitride, lithium niobate, gallium arsenide, diamond), as well as RF/cryogenic substrates utilizing Josephson Junctions (e.g., RF_HyPeC512 at 100 GHz), quantum dots, superconducting nanowire detectors, and NV centers.
	Lattice Topologies: Implementations scaling through D₄, Dₙ (n≥4), E₈(240), E₉, Ammann quasicrystals, 3D/4D lattices, and hyperbolic tessellations.
	Octad Instruction Set Architectures (ISA): Non-binary tuples executing specific, fully detailed computational primitives including but not limited to: HOLO_SLICE, TENSOR_MVM, MEM_STORE/RECALL, LOGIC_COMPARE, FFT/IFFT, CONVOLUTION, HASH_COMPUTE, ENCRYPT/DECRYPT, SVD_DECOMP, LAPLACIAN_SOLVE, TOPO_INVARIANT, QUANTUM_GATE, and ERROR_CORRECT.
	Error Correction (QEC) Embodiments: Holographic syndrome extraction, Gauge-Fixed Holographic Surface Codes, Hyperinvariant codes, and Majorana-Dimer implementations executing natively on the lattice.
	The Complete Software Ecosystem: The DLRA-IR, \theta8 binary executable format, cycle-accurate MEEP/FDTD simulators, JIT runtime, and explicit compiler optimization passes (Fuse_HoloTensor, InterfCancel, LatticeFold, Syndrome Parallel, MemCoherence).
The non-provisional utility application is imminent and claims the full scope of these multi-substrate, multi-dimensional embodiments enabled by the February 20, 2026 priority date.
2. Mathematical Enablement & The Inevitability of the Architecture
The theoretical foundation proving the universality of these DLRA embodiments is currently undergoing public release.
	Currently Available: 
	Φ-Basin Chapters 1-16, detailing the β-triad to E₈/D₄ foundational mathematics (zenodo.org/records/18706843 | zenodo.org/records/18721965).
	The E₉ Mathematical Verification Engine and associated paper. This release publicly demonstrates the exact symbolic and numeric proofs mapping the D₉ Cartan algebra to fundamental physics (Euler's identity, π, Ricci curvature) (https://zenodo.org/records/18750338)
The E₉ mathematical proofs mathematically guarantee the enablement of the E₈ and E₉ DLRA hardware architectures. The physical universe operates on these topological laws. We have patented the exclusive hardware and software frameworks capable of directly manipulating these physical and mathematical realities.
3. Public Disclosures as Proof of Enablement
Under U.S. patent law, the publication of working code and mathematical verification engines constitutes a public demonstration of an enabled embodiment explicitly claimed in our February 20, 2026, provisional filing.
The release of the Φ-Basin mathematics and the E₉ verification engines serves as definitive, working proof of enablement for the DLRA architectures and ISAs. This legally solidifies our priority date and proves the architecture is computationally sound. Any unauthorized commercial implementation, derivation, or reverse-engineering of the principles demonstrated in this published working code constitutes willful infringement of our established priority claims.
